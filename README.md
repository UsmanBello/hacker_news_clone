This is a simple clone of Hacker news(https://news.ycombinator.com/news). I have used their API to fetch the live data(Top stories and New  Stories) which is being displayed on the Home page(TOP STORIES are displayed) and new page( NEW STORIES are displayed)

The official hacker news API can be found here - (https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
